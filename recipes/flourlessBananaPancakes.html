    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 very ripe banana, mashed</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ground flax seed (Optional)</li>
      <li>Â¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract (Optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix together mashed banana and beaten eggs in a large bowl until smooth.
        Add ground flax seed and vanilla; mix until batter is well combined.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat coconut oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Scoop batter,
        about 1/4 cup per pancake, onto the skillet and cook until the centers
        start to bubble, about 30 seconds. Flip pancakes and continue cooking
        until the bottoms are lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with
        remaining batter.
